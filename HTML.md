## HTML
* The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
* <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 
* HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
* HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
* HTML images are defined with the <img> tag: <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
* HTML Element: The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
* The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
* HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
* You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page.
* The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
  <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
* The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
* The HTML <br> element defines a line break.Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
* The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
* style: <tagname style="property:value;">
* Formatting the Elements:
<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text

* Table: The <table> tag defines an HTML table.Each table row is defined with a <tr> tag. Each table header is defined with a <th> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <td> tag.By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered.By default, the text in <td> elements are regular and left-aligned.
To add a caption to a table, use the <caption> tag:

* Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line.A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.The <div> element is a block-level element.
* Inline element: An inline element does not start on a new line.An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
* <div> : The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
* The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document
* The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.
* To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}:
* You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.
The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
* A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:
* The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
* The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data)
The <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag
The <title> element is required and it defines the title of the document
The <style> element is used to define style information for a single document
The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets
The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings
The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts
The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page
* A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
The <section> element defines a section in a document.
* form - 
<input type="text">	Displays a single-line text input field
<input type="radio">	Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
